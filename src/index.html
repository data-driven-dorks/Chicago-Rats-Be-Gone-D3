                <p>
                    In 2018, we saw a total of 37,577 rat complaints in Chicago. Compared with other major US cities
                    like New York and Los
                    Angeles, and cities that were historically troubled by rodent infestations such as Detroit, Chicago
                    not only had the
                    highest total complaint count, but appeared to have the largest number of complaints per capita.

                <h3>Time Pattern of Rat Complaints</h3>
                <p>
                    From 2014 to 2018 in Chicago, rat complaints were most frequent in the summer, indicating that rats
                    were
                    potentially most rampant at that time (or at least more likely to be seen). Summer is when
                    temperatures are most
                    moderate for smell of decayed food to spread and for rodents to move around. The higher level of
                    human activities
                    may result in greater amount of trash that appeals to rats. <strong

                <h3>Surrounding Premises Where Rat Complaints Are Filed</h3>
                <p>
                    It seems that most complaints were filed near premises or buildings associated with unhandled
                    garbage from 2014 to 2018.
                    Indeed, acting as potential food sources, garbage is most appealing to rodents. It is important for
                    the city government
                    to make sure all properties empty garbage with a timely manner. <strong

                <p>
                    Rats, see vacant houses as their prime real estate. Such places offer
                    hassle-free shelter;
                    nooks and crannies for hiding and playing; carpeting for nests; and toilet bowls for swimming.
                    Indeed, this plot shows that communities with more vacant properties seem to see more rat complaints
                    in Chicago.
